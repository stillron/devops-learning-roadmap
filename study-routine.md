# 🧭 Study Routine (Optional Guide)

This file is **not required** to complete the DevOps learning plan.  
Use it only if you ever feel stuck, scattered, or want a rhythm to follow.

Think of it like a gym warm-up playlist — helpful, but never mandatory.

## 🔁 Suggested Weekly Rhythm (10–12 hrs/week)

| Day | Time | Focus |
|------|------|-------|
| Mon | 1–2 hrs | Read docs, watch demos, take no notes yet |
| Tue | 2 hrs | Start the week's main build task |
| Wed | 2 hrs | Debug, experiment, break things on purpose |
| Thu | 2 hrs | Commit code, push to GitHub |
| Fri | 1 hr | Quick reflection + small win |
| Weekend (optional) | 2 hrs | Catch-up or stretch goal |

✅ If you miss a day, nothing collapses  
✅ If you only do Mon + Tue + Thu, you still made real progress  
✅ You *do not* owe this file anything — it's here to help you, not boss you

## 🔍 3-Step Daily Flow (30 sec to remember)

1. **Start** → “Today I will _____” (one sentence)  
2. **Work** → small, real, hands-on step  
3. **End** → commit + tiny note (“got Postgres running!”)

That’s it.  
No journaling walls. No perfect discipline needed.

## ✅ What Success Actually Looks Like

Success is **not**:

- Finishing every task on time  
- Never falling behind  
- Doing the perfect routine every week

Success **is**:

- You are still moving forward 2 weeks from now  
- Your GitHub has more commits each month  
- You can explain something today you couldn’t last week  
- You feel more like an engineer than an “IT person pretending”  

That’s it. That’s the game.

## 🧠 If You Ever Feel Overwhelmed

Use this reset checklist:

- [ ] Pick *one* task from the main roadmap  
- [ ] Do a *15-minute version* of it  
- [ ] Commit even the smallest success (`init commit: docker running`)  
- [ ] Walk away feeling like a win, not a failure

Progress = momentum, not perfection.

## 💪 Personal Reminder

You’ve already:
- Managed OPNsense firewalls in CARP  
- Set up OAuth2-Proxy, Let’s Encrypt, Nginx  
- Built dynamic web apps with n8n + Hugo  
- Run production PostgreSQL and FreeIPA  
- Migrated Proxmox & Debian fleets

You are **not starting from zero**.  
You’re leveling up from “senior sysadmin” to “cloud-native DevOps engineer.”

And you absolutely can.
